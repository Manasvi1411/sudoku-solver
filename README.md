# Sudoku Solver (Java)

A GUI-based Sudoku Solver application developed in Java using Swing.  
The project follows a modular design with clear separation between user interface, solving logic, and database handling.

## Features
- User login system
- Interactive Sudoku grid
- Automatic Sudoku solving
- Puzzle history tracking
- Database-backed storage using JDBC

## Project Structure
- `LoginPage.java` – Application entry point and user authentication
- `SudokuFrontend.java` – Main Sudoku user interface
- `SudokuSolver.java` – Core Sudoku solving logic
- `SudokuDB.java` – Database connectivity and data management
- `PuzzleViewer.java` – Displays Sudoku puzzles
- `HistoryWindow.java` – Shows previously solved puzzles

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- JDBC

## How to Run
1. Compile all `.java` files.
2. Run `LoginPage.java` to start the application.
3. Log in to access the Sudoku interface.
4. Use the solver to solve puzzles and view history.

## Project Overview
This project was developed as an academic application to strengthen understanding of Java programming, GUI development, modular design, and database integration. It demonstrates clean separation of responsibilities across multiple classes.
